Key Definitions
Kernel: The core part of the operating system that manages system resources and hardware communication.
Shell: A command-line interpreter that allows users to interact with the operating system.
Distribution (Distro): A version of Linux that includes the Linux kernel, software packages, and a package management system.
Root: The superuser account with administrative privileges.
Daemon: A background process that runs without user intervention, often providing services to other programs.
